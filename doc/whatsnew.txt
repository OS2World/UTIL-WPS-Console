 [!] Bug fix

 0.1.0
 ----- 02-Oct-97 first release
  [;]  I`ve waited for comments on version 0.0.9 for some time and now
       here is the first release. Not many changes comparing to 0.0.9, anyway.
  [;]  WARNING: I`ve compiled online manual (CONSOLE.INF) in the 866`th
       codepage (russian) since the book contains a chapter in Russian.
       If you`re unable to read the book on a system with a different
       codepage (say 437,850) please mail me -- I`ll look for workarounds :-(
       In the meantime, you can recompile the book with src/doc/prep.cmd
       replacing "-D:7 -C:866" with "-D:1 -C:437" or whatever is appropiate.
  [!]  Now -p#,#,#,# properly resizes the window when session is minimized.
  [!]  If you didn`t set default console position and font size (with
       Shift+Mouse drag/with FontSize dialog), Console will not set them
       to 0 first time it is run.
  [!]  Now Console is multitask-safe, i.e. running multiple copies at once
       will work as expected (however, since there is a need to serialize
       OS2.INI access they will not run in parralel, but rather one after
       other).

 0.0.9
 ----- 01-Aug-97
  [;]  public pre-release
  [+]  Now Console can change the font of the window it was launched from.
  [+]  New program - CWRP - used to process some PM events 'externally'
       since not anything can be done from within a VIO process. However,
       you shouldn`t run it manually since it was designed to be run
       automatically when it is needed.
  [+]  Most options now works both 'locally' (on the window Console runs from)
       and externally (on the newly-created window).
  [+]  New switch to set the console title -t"...".
  [+]  New switch to make window border+title flash (-of{+|-}). Removed
       duplicated switch "-of" (foreground session) you can achieve
       the same result as -of+ with -ob-.
  [+]  New switch to change window border size (-b{w,h})
  [+]  When Console starts a new window with -s#,# option, it starts it
       invisible, then resizes it, then shows it (if -ov- has not been
       specified). This removes annoying flashes.

 0.0.3
 ----- 11-Jul-97
  [*]  Changed the utility name from wOpen to Console.
  [*]  Most state change switches has moved under '-o' switch.
  [*]  By default Console changes current window, to start a new session
       use -on switch.
  [*]  Now Console detects "font size..." entry in OS2.INI by three dots (...)
       since has proven that its name is translated in different versions of
       OS/2 (oh, shit...), but (I hope) they always contains those three dots.
  [+]  Console autocomputes the size of newly-launched window, if you do not
       specify it. So, if you run, say, Console -p0,0 -f8,8 -s10,10 *,
       this will start a new session positioned at (0,0), and not "randomly"
       positioned as before.
  [!]  Now Console can start active sessions from inactive windows.
  [+]  Added ability to change same session window from where it was run.
       The following parameters can be changed: window cell size (analogous
       to MODE command), window position (-pX,Y), window size (-p,,W,H),
       window's maximized (-ox), minimized (-om), visible (-ov),
       foreground (-of or -ob) states. The -ox- and -om- switches are
       equivalent to [system menu]->[restore] entry.
