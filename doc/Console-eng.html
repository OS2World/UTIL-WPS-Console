<P>
<H1>Purpose</H1>
This utility addresses a problem <B>IBM</B> is ignoring since first release of OS/2.
The problem is, you can define the default size and position for *ALL* console
windows (including DOS windowed VDMs) but you can`t do it apart. This program
allows you do it, although, alas, it is not integrated into WPS.
</P>
<P>
The program was rather one of my first experiences in C, so please take it into account.
It is not too sophisticated, but at least does what it was built for.
</P>
<H1>Command-line</H1>
<P>
The command-line format looks as follows:
</P>
<PRE>Console {options} {program} {...program options...}</PRE>
<P>
If you`re typing some options too often, you can put them into a environment
variable. That variable is treated exactly as command-line, except that it is
processed before command-line. So, say, if you don`t like ANSI colored output (see below),
you can put
</P>
<PRE>set CONSOLE=-oa-</PRE>
<P>
into your CONFIG.SYS file. If you, however, want to override some options in environment
variable, you can still do it (in above case by using "-oa" on Console command line).
By default Console will NOT start a new window, so the options you type will
change the console window Console was started from. Switches that works
only when starting a new window are marked with /N/, those that works for
current window are marked with /C/.
Following options are available:
</P>
<DL>
<DT>-b{w,h} /C/N/
<DD>Set window border thickness ([W]idth and [H]eight);
<DT>-f{h,w} /C/N/
<DD>Set window font [W]idth and [H]eight. You can see what font sizes are available by
opening the <I>Font Size</I> dialog from any windowed session popup menu.
Without any arguments (-f) it will read current window's font size
(for example, you can use this with -q option, see below).
<DT>-o{a|b|c|d|f|m|n|r|s|v|x}{+|-}
<DD>Enable (+) or disable (-) one of following [O]ptions:
<DL>
 <DT>a /C/N/
 <DD>Turn on (+)/off (-) [A]NSI colored output. Someday I`ve realized that
 not everybody likes the neat colors I`m using :-).
 <DT>b /C/N/
 <DD>Start a background (+) or foreground (-) session.
 <DT>c /N/
 <DD>auto[C]lose on termination (+) or leave window until user closes it
 <DT>d /N/
 <DD>Enable (+) or disable (-) a small [D]elay after running command
     Use this if you experience problems with -p starting a new session
     The program temporarily changes some entries in OS2.INI file, then
     starts the session, and finally changes them back. However, I`m not
     sure <I>when</I> exactly I should change them back, so this option
     is provided. If you encounter problems even with it, please mail me.
 <DT>f /C/N/
 <DD>Start window title [F]lashing (+) or stop flashing (-)
 <DT>m /C/N/
 <DD>Start session [M]inimized (+) or non-minimized (-)
 <DT>n /N/
 <DD>Start a [N]ew session (+) or change same window (-)
 <DT>r /C/
 <DD>[R]esize window to max possible size (+) or leave as-is (-)
 <DT>s /N/
 <DD>auto[S]ize window: compute the size of new window based on known
     console window size and console font size (overriden by -p,,#,#)
 <DT>v /C/N/
 <DD>Start a [V]isible console window (+) or invisible (-)
 <DT>x /C/N/
 <DD>Start session ma[X]imized (+) or non-maximized (-)
</DL>
<DT>-p{{x}{,{y}{,{w}{,h}}}}
<DD>Set window position (X, Y) and size (W, H) (in pixels). Note that the size is
impossible to set on a maximized window, so -ox- is enforced if you will specify
at least one of W,H values (for a new session only). Note that you can skip some
values, and they will remain at their default values. For example -p,,100 will
only set the width of the window. This switch even works for <I>current</I>
window, so if you want to set current's window position to (0,0) you should
run: Console -p0,0 -- but, if you want to start a <I>new</I> window at (0,0)
you should run: Console -p0,0 -on<BR>
Without any parameters -p will read current window's size and position. So,
for example, if you want to start a new window at same X position as current
window and Y=0 you should use Console -p -p,0
<DT>-s{w,h}
<DD>re[S]ize window as using "MODE W,H" command.
This switch can be used only on OS/2 sessions since DOS sessions cannot be
resised to other that 80x25 or 80x50 sizes.
<DT>-q
<DD>Display a sample command line to start a window with current
size/shape (possibly modified by command-line options).
For example, Console -q will show (among others) the -p switch with
default window position and -f with the default window font, while the
Console -p -f -q command will show <B>current</B> window position and
<B>current</B> window font.
<DT>-t"..."
<DD>Set window title. When starting a new session title will become 'sticky',
i.e. any program which runs inside that new session cannot change that
title anymore. For current session title can be changed only
 <OL>
 <LI>if current window title is not already 'sticky'
 <LI>for a single program (i.e. you should use the form
      Console -t"..." myprog.exe args)
 <LI>if that program does not change title itself (as File Commander does,
     for example).
 </OL>
Sorry, that`s the way OS/2 session manager works.
<DT>-w{a|d|o}
<DD>[W]indow type: [D]OS/[O]S2/[A]utodetect; default = OS/2
The [A]utodetect option is not recommended since it can start as well
a full-screen session.
</DL>
<P>
Default state of switches: 
</P> -oa+ -oc+ -od- -of- -om- -on- -or- -os+ -ov+ -ox- -wo
<H1>Examples</H1>
<PRE>Console -wo -f18,10 -p200,100 -on t-mail.exe -c</PRE>
<P>
This command will run "t-mail.exe -c" in a OS/2 windowed session, with 10x18 font size,
window will be placed at 200,100 position.
</P>
<PRE>Console -s40,25 -p,,300,100 -f8,8 -oc- *</PRE>
<P>
This command will open a OS/2 windowed session at 40x25 cells size, with 8x8 font and
with a 300x100 pixel size. The window will not be automatically closed.
</P>
<PRE>Console -ob -s60,20 -p10,10,488,186 -f8,8 *</PRE>
<P>
This will open a background OS/2 session with a 60x20 size, placed at 10,10, with a size of
488,186 pixels and with a 8x8 font.
</P>
<PRE>Console -f -p -on</PRE>
<P>
This will 'clone' current window.
</P>
<H1>Window size</H1>
<P>
Window position/size relations are a bit tricky. First, the X coordinate is always
rounded to nearest 8 divisor (even on 256- 64K- 16M- color modes -- hey, IBM, wake
up! 21st Century ahead!). For example, if you`ll try the command:
</P>
<PRE>Console -os- -on -p0,0,800,400 -f8,8 *</PRE>
you`ll get a window with X ~= 0 (rounded to 8 since window border added a bit to your 0)
and Y somewhere in the middle of the screen (on my 1024x768 resolution). Why?
</P>
<P>
The answer is that for some unknown reason, when the internals of a VIO window are resized,
the <I>top-left</I> corner of the window is unchanged while lower-left corner moves. This
is a contradiction to the PM paradigm which counts coordinates from lower-left corner, but who
in IBM cares anyway?!
</P>
<P>
There are a number of approaches for setting window sizes. First is,
of course, try-and-see method :-) I`m often using it when I`m too lazy to
multiply some numbers. Other approach is to multiply window size in cells
with font dimenstion, then add border size. For example, a 60x20 window
with a 8x8 font will have the following size:
</P>
<PRE>Width  = 60 * 8 + 4 + 4 = 488
Height = 20 * 8 + 4 + 4 + 18 = 186</PRE>
<P>
4 is the border width/height (this depends of your scheme palette), 18 is
the height of titlebar.
</P>
<P>
And the third approach is to launch a window, set its position/size manually
(say using a mouse) and then query them. It can be done with a utility
called PMMon - a nice tool for any programmer, but not for consumer :-)
</P>
<H2>Note</H2>
<P>
Program versions above 0.0.3 contains an 'auto-size' feature (enabled by default) which
will do everything said above for you. If you don`t like it, you can turn it off
(using -os- switch). So, now you can simply type:
<PRE>
Console -on -f8,8 -s60,20 -p0,0
</PRE>
and this will really start a new console at (0,0). You can try same as above
with the -os- switch to see what will happen.
